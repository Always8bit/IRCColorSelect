# IRCColorSelect
I use the IRC client Smuxi. It's weird as in it supports IRC colors, but doesn't have a way to input them. This little program is something I wrote in a few hours to allow me to use IRC colors with Smuxi. 

I love Smuxi's layout and client / server structure, but the lack of making colored text from within the program is really the only thing left before it's near-perfect in my eyes. This is a really bad workaround for myself in the mean time! :D
